 * Kernel-owned identity map of the first 4 GiB (VA == PA) using 2 MiB pages.
 *
 * Why this exists (UEFI product path, P-BOOT-1)
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * After ExitBootServices the firmware page tables still map enough of RAM for
 * the EFI loader to jump into KERNEL.ELF, but those tables are not ours:
 *   - PT pages may be read-only or incomplete for later HHDM / VMM edits
 *   - firmware may not cover the full low 4 GiB the early kernel assumes
 *   - we must not leave CR3 pointing at reclaimable BootServices memory
 *
 * Multiboot path already builds this same layout in arch/x86_64/boot.S before
 * kmain. This file is the pure-C twin for kmain_uefi → boot_install_identity_4gib().
 *
 * Layout (must match boot.S)
 * --------------------------
 *   g_aPt layout, 6 × 4 KiB pages, 4 KiB-aligned:
 *     [0] PML4   — only slot 0 used → PDPT
 *     [1] PDPT   — slots 0..3 → PD0..PD3 (one GiB each)
 *     [2..5] PD0..PD3 — 512 × 2 MiB PS leaves each → 4 GiB total
 *
 * Leaf PTE flags: PRESENT | RW | PS (2 MiB). No NX / user / global bits —
 * early boot only; VMM installs product maps (HHDM, W^X, SMEP/SMAP) later.
 *
 * Soft product surface
 * --------------------
 * After CR3 load (serial already up on UEFI path), emit greppable soft markers
 * for identity install and the published gj_boot_info (GOP / memmap / handoff).
 *
 * Wave 49 exclusive soft deepen (this unit only — greppable "identity: soft …"):
 *   identity: soft honesty    — bridge only; higher-half product OPEN
 *   identity: soft inventory  — pt/pd/leaf cover snapshot + wave stamp
 *   identity: soft layout     — PML4/PDPT/PD phys addresses
 *   identity: soft pd         — per-GiB PD leaf tallies
 *   identity: soft geometry   — 4 GiB / 2 MiB leaf design constants
 *   identity: soft flags      — leaf/link PTE flag inventory
 *   identity: soft cover      — cover/match/align/pml4/pdpt lamps
 *   identity: soft cr3        — expect/read/match soft classify
 *   identity: soft link       — PML4[0] + PDPT[0..3] link soft
 *   identity: soft pml4       — slot0 link + upper-slot empty soft
 *   identity: soft stats      — install/log counters + leaf rollup
 *   identity: soft path       — UEFI install path honesty catalog
 *   identity: soft leaf       — Wave 15 leaf rollup surface
 *   identity: soft zero       — Wave 15 upper-slot empty surface
 *   identity: soft twin       — Wave 15 Multiboot boot.S twin note
 *   identity: soft install    — Wave 15 install counter surface
 *   identity: soft catalog    — Wave 19 area name rollup
 *   identity: soft deepen     — wave=49 stamp + area count
 *   identity: soft PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL …
 *   boot: identity soft PASS …
 *   boot: handoff soft … / boot: memmap soft … / boot: GOP soft …
 *     (via boot_info_soft_log when source is UEFI)
 *
 * greppable: identity: soft
 * greppable: identity: soft honesty
 * greppable: identity: soft deepen
 * greppable: boot: identity soft
 *
 * Limits (not product end-state)
 * ------------------------------
 *   - Covers only [0, 4 GiB). Machines with >4 GiB RAM still boot; PMM uses
 *     the firmware memory map for usable frames, then HHDM grows coverage
 *     (P-MEM-3 / P-MEM-5). This map is a bridge, not the 1 TiB bar.
 *   - Higher-half product move remains OPEN (soft honesty; never claims HH).
 *   - g_aPt lives in kernel BSS and must remain identity-reachable while
 *     CR3 points here (linked in the low identity window of the product ELF).
 *   - Call once, early, after ExitBootServices and before VMM mutates tables.
 *
 * Pure C11 freestanding; dual MIT OR Apache-2.0. No assembly required.
